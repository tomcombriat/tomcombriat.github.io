# Electronic saxophone

## Presentation

Since I was young, I was always interested into getting weird sounds out of my sax, starting with shovelling a microphone in the bell and plugging it into guitar pedals. Growing up and moving into flats where the noise level created by an acoustic saxophone can be a concern, another motivation was to be able to play silent, with headphones, allowing practice even in the middle of the night.
