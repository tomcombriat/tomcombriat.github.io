# Electronic saxophone

## Presentation

Since I was young, I was always interested into getting weird sounds out of my sax, starting with shovelling a microphone in the bell and plugging it into guitar pedals. Growing up and moving into flats where the noise level created by an acoustic saxophone can be a concern, another motivation was to be able to play silent, with headphones, allowing practice even in the middle of the night.

I then got an EWI (Electronic Wind Instrument) from [undisclosed brand]. This particular EWI was only acting as an USB-MIDI controller, which was not a bad thing because I was fairly knowledgeable of GNU/Linux suite of free synthesizers. This instrument would be tactile for the pressed keys and have an analog sensor for the breath, the latter outputting as a MIDI-CC signal (it apparently also had a "bite" sensor, but I never managed to understand how that worked, or how to make it react). Having the breath as a MIDI-CC is practical as it allows to control a variety of parameters but unfortunately very few synthesizers would be able to use that data in an expressive way, with the notable exception of [Phasex](https://github.com/williamweston/phasex) (a very powerful and surprisingly fast synthesizer, with maybe a bit too many parameters). That would rule out most simple synths and sampler like QSynth or [AMsynth](https://amsynth.github.io/).

But the problem was not thereâ€¦
